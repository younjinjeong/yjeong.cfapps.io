## Writing a _Good_ Post

_copied from [the README](https://github.com/pivotal/blog#writing-a-good-post)..._

### Keep it technical.

People want to to be educated and enlightened.  Our audience are engineers, so the way to reach them is through code.  The more code samples, the better.

### Nobody likes a wall of text.

Use headers to break up your text.  Each image you add to your post increases its XP by 100.  Diagrams, screen shots, or humorous "meme" (_|memƒÅ|_) gifs...  They all add color.  If you don't have [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), then submit an ask ticket.  There's no excuse for monotony.

### Your 10th grade teacher was right.

Make use of the hamburger technique.  Your audience doesn't have a lot of time.  Tell them what you're going to write, write it, and then tell them what you've written.  Spend time on your opening.  Make it click.

### Pair all the time.

We do everything as a team, and this is no different.  Get feedback from your friends and coworkers.  Show them the post on the staging site, and ask them to tear it apart.

### Make it pretty.

Pivotal-ui comes with a bunch of nice helpers.  Make use of them.  Check out the example styles below:

---

# Header 1 

Don't use this, since it looks like a main title.

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
